Well! I finally got around to putting this old website together. Welcome to my all things data journal.  Here, you can read posts about data and learn with me as I explore the exciting word of machine learning technologies and big data. I am passionate about exploring the root issues behind relevant problems, and then using data to help build innovative products or find impactful solutions for millions of people around the world to improve the way people work and think.  Letâ€™s learn together.

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Asante Sana
