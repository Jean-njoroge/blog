A few weeks ago, a colleague asked me - “How Machine Learning is Applicable Material Science?”. It got me interested, because these are two topics, I understand very well. We both studied Computational Material Science (Material Informatics), utilized python and other tools to build models, evaluated terabytes of data from simulations, used statistical mechanics and numerical methods to extract useful insights on the structure-property relationships of material. Indeed, machine learning methods, sounds familiar to a computational material scientist, but it is an elusive familiarity.  In this blog, I will examine areas in which machine learning and material science intertwine.
 
> *Our everyday existence in influence by materials, from Silicon chips store data in billionths of a second, to new alloys for automobile engines, to solar panels for renewable energy. Indeed, advances in materials shape our day-to-day lives and drive economic growth. Simply put materials make things happen.*

Propelled by [Materials Genome](https://www.mgi.gov/) Initiative; algorithmic developments; and the unquestionable successes of data-driven efforts in other domains, informatics strategies are beginning to take shape within materials science. Using material properties data and advanced computer models, engineers can realistically simulate the behavior of new materials in specific applications and avoid lengthy cycles of build and test.  These simulations cover a wide range of operating environments and length and time scales. The new field, called computational materials science, is one of the fastest growing areas within the field of chemistry and materials science.
