A few weeks ago, a colleague asked me - “How Machine Learning is Applicable Material Science?”. It got me interested, because these are two topics, I understand very well. We both studied Computational Material Science (Material Informatics), utilized python and other tools to build models, evaluated terabytes of data from simulations, used statistical mechanics and numerical methods to extract useful insights on the structure-property relationships of material. Indeed, machine learning methods, sounds familiar to a computational material scientist, but it is an elusive familiarity.  In this blog, I will examine areas in which machine learning and material science intertwine.
> *Our everyday existence in influence by materials, from Silicon chips store data in billionths of a second, to new alloys for automobile engines, to solar panels for renewable energy. Indeed, advances in materials shape our day-to-day lives and drive economic growth. Simply put materials make things happen.*

Propelled by [Materials Genome Initiative](https://www.mgi.gov/) ; algorithmic developments; and unquestionable successes of data-driven efforts in other domains, informatics strategies are beginning to take shape within materials science. Using material properties data and advanced computer models, engineers can realistically simulate the behavior of new materials in specific applications and avoid lengthy cycles of build and test.  These simulations cover a wide range of operating environments and length and time scales. The new field, called computational materials science, is one of the fastest growing areas within the field of chemistry and materials science.

### Basic steps of Machine learning in Material Science

Machine learning is a method of automating analytical model building, using algorithms that iteratively learn from data. This allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed. Much has been written about machine learning and how our daily activities; web searches, credit scoring, fraud detection, and text analysis amongst others influenced by this field. In material science, the infinite goal is finding new materials with good performance. In material science, machine learning has been used in areas such as new materials discovery and material property prediction.

Regardless of problem under study, a criterion for machine learning is existence of past data, either clean, curated and reliable data corresponding to the problem under study should already be available, or an effort is in place for the creation of the data.
Basic steps of machine learning in material science, involves three steps, sample generation, module building and model evaluations (pic).
* **Sample construction:** raw data is collected from computational simulations and experimental measurements. Mostly, data is incomplete, noisy and inconsistent, hence, data cleaning should be performed when constructing a sample from raw data. 
* **Model building**: input data is linked to output data using a set of nonlinear or linear functions. in materials science, complex relationships usually exist between the conditional factors and the target attributes, which traditional methods have difficulty handling. For example, in an experiment on predicting the glass transition temperature Tg it is difficult to find a formula that can accurately describe the rela- tionship between Tg and the four relevant factors of rigidness, chain mobility, average molecular polarizability and net charge; however, a machine learning method can be used to model the relationships between conditional factors and decision attributes based on a given sample. This is where machine learning plays a role and where the “core” algorithms lie. The knowledge obtained through machine learning is stored in a format that is readily usable and, in turn, can be used for materials discovery and design. 
* **Model evaluations**: A data-driven model should achieve good performance not only on existing data but also on unseen data. Generally, we can evaluate the generalization errors of models by means of calculation-based tests and use the results to select the best one.
