A few weeks ago, a colleague asked me this question. We both studied Computational Material Science (Material Informatics) and thus it can be a bit of confusion, because we use python, we evaluate terabytes of data, and use numerical methods, so machine learning methods, sounds familiar to a computational material scientist, but itâ€™s an elusive familiarity.  

Materials science relates microstructure of a material to its macromolecular physical and chemical properties. Material scientists tailor the properties to create custom, or even brand new, materials with specific properties for specific uses, by first understanding and then changing the microstructure. I like to think of it as a complex system.

There are two common methods of studying materials properties: computational simulation and experimental measurement. These two. The pioneering applications of machine learning in materials science can be traced back to the 1990s, when machine learning methods such as symbol methods and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were employed to predict the corrosion behavior and the tensile and compressive strengths of the fiber/matrix interfaces in ceramic-matrix
