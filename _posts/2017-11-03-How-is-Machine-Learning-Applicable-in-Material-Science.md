*Simply put, materials make things happen*


A few weeks ago, a colleague asked me - “How Machine Learning is Applicable Material Science?”. It got me interested, because these are two topics, I understand very well. We both studied Computational Material Science (Material Informatics), utilized python and other tools to build models, evaluated terabytes of data from simulations, used statistical mechanics and numerical methods to extract useful insights on the structure-property relationships of material. Indeed, machine learning methods, sounds familiar to a computational material scientist, but it is an elusive familiarity.  In this blog, I will examine areas in which machine learning and computation material science intertwine.
