“Exploratory data analysis isolates patterns and features of the data and reveals these forcefully to the analyst.” (Hoaglin, Mosteller, & Tukey, 1983, p. 1)

I am a curious person, perhaps the reason why as part of the data analysis task, 
exploration of the data is one of my favorite.  In this post, I look at a high level of what EDA entails, 
describe ways in which EDA is essential in both exploratory and predictive modeling. 
As I continue learning and updating my DS skills, I hope that this post will spark your curiosity as you 
know why EDA should be part of the way data science operates in your organization.
